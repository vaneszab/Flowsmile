# Flowsmile
Introducing Flowsmile!. it is an advanced website for data mining project that can predict the types of flowers. Specifically designed for classifying daisies, lilies, and sunflowers, Flowsmile has achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 97%.

The core technology behind Flowsmile lies in its extensive database of flower images and its sophisticated machine learning algorithms. The project team has curated a vast collection of high-resolution images, encompassing diverse varieties of daisies, lilies, and sunflowers. These images serve as the training dataset for the machine learning model, which learns the unique patterns and features of each flower type.
To access the Flowsmile service, users simply need to upload an image of the flower they want to classify. Within seconds, the system processes the image, applies the trained model, and produces a predicted classification with high confidence. The user is then provided with the most probable flower type, along with a confidence score indicating the certainty of the prediction.
